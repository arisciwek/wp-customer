# TODO-2183: Refactor - DataTable Centralization (Task-2176 Fix)

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Priority**: HIGH
**Created**: 2025-11-01
**Completed**: 2025-11-01

## Context

Task-2176 reported that customer_admin users could see the Disnaker menu but couldn't see the list of agencies related to them. This was caused by wp-agency still using legacy AgencyModel::getDataTableData() instead of the centralized wp-app-core DataTable pattern.

## Problem

1. **wp-agency** was NOT fully utilizing AgencyDataTableModel (which extends wp-app-core)
2. **AgencyController** was calling AgencyModel::getDataTableData() instead of AgencyDataTableModel
3. **Permission filtering logic** was duplicated in AgencyModel instead of being in AgencyDataTableModel
4. **AgencyAccessFilter** (wp-customer integration) was working, but the underlying architecture was incorrect

## Solution

### Architecture Refactor

**BEFORE (❌ Wrong)**:
```
AgencyController → AgencyModel::getDataTableData() → Complex 160-line method
```

**AFTER (✅ Correct)**:
```
AgencyController → AgencyDataTableModel::get_datatable_data() → wp-app-core pattern
```

### Changes Made

#### 1. wp-customer (No Code Changes)

✅ AgencyAccessFilter.php - Already compatible!
- Auto-detects table alias ('a' vs 'p')
- Hooks into `wpapp_datatable_app_agencies_where` filter
- Filters agencies based on customer branches

**No changes needed** - filter continues to work with refactored architecture.

#### 2. wp-agency (Major Refactor)

**File: src/Models/Agency/AgencyDataTableModel.php**
- ✅ Moved permission filtering FROM AgencyModel TO get_where()
- ✅ Added employee JOIN to base_joins
- ✅ Handles status filtering, permission checks, and hook integration
- ✅ Fully utilizes wp-app-core DataTable pattern

**File: src/Controllers/AgencyController.php**
- ✅ Added `use WPAgency\Models\Agency\AgencyDataTableModel;`
- ✅ Updated handleDataTableRequest() to use AgencyDataTableModel
- ✅ Simplified getAgencyTableData() method
- ✅ Removed generateActionButtons() (now in AgencyDataTableModel)

**File: src/Models/Agency/AgencyModel.php**
- ✅ Deprecated getDataTableData() method (backward compatibility)
- ✅ Returns empty result with deprecation log

## Benefits

### 1. **Clean Separation of Concerns**
- AgencyModel = Pure CRUD (create, read, update, delete)
- AgencyDataTableModel = DataTable operations only
- AgencyController = Request handling and caching

### 2. **Consistent with wp-app-core Pattern**
- All plugins now use same DataTable architecture
- Easier for new developers to understand
- Reduces code duplication

### 3. **Better Maintainability**
- DataTable changes → Touch only AgencyDataTableModel
- CRUD changes → Touch only AgencyModel
- No mixing of concerns

### 4. **Cross-Plugin Integration Works**
- wp-customer AgencyAccessFilter continues to work seamlessly
- Hook-based filtering (`wpapp_datatable_app_agencies_where`)
- customer_admin can now see Disnaker list ✅

## Testing Results

**Test User**: andi_budi (ID: 2)
- Role: customer_admin ✓
- Has view_agency_list capability: ✓
- Employee record exists: ✓
- Branch has agency_id = 28: ✓
- Agency "Disnaker Provinsi Maluku" accessible: ✓

**AgencyAccessFilter Simulation**:
```
✓ User IS customer employee (ID: 31)
✓ Accessible agencies: [28]
✓ Filter adds: WHERE a.id IN (28)
```

## Files Modified

### wp-customer
- No changes (already compatible)

### wp-agency
1. `src/Models/Agency/AgencyDataTableModel.php` - Major update
2. `src/Controllers/AgencyController.php` - Updated to use AgencyDataTableModel
3. `src/Models/Agency/AgencyModel.php` - Deprecated getDataTableData()

## Impact

- ✅ Task-2176 FIXED: customer_admin can see Disnaker list
- ✅ Code quality improved (separation of concerns)
- ✅ Architecture aligned with wp-app-core standards
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained (deprecated method)
- ✅ Cross-plugin integration intact

## Follow-up: Agency Employee Filtering (2025-11-01)

### Problem
After implementing AgencyAccessFilter, customer_admin users could see the agency list correctly filtered to only their accessible agencies. However, they could still see **ALL agency employees** across all agencies, not just those from their accessible agencies.

**Example**:
- User: andi_budi (ID: 2, role: customer_admin)
- Branch: PT Maju Bersama Cabang Cilacap (branch_id: 12)
- Accessible agency: Disnaker Jawa Tengah (agency_id: 26)
- **Problem**: Could see employees from agency_id = 21, 22, 23, etc. (should only see agency_id = 26)

### Root Cause
EmployeeDataTableModel in wp-agency had **no filter hook** for cross-plugin integration. While AgencyDataTableModel had `wpapp_datatable_app_agencies_where` filter, EmployeeDataTableModel did not have an equivalent filter.

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Added Filter Hook in wp-agency

**File**: `wp-agency/src/Models/Employee/EmployeeDataTableModel.php` (v1.2.1)

Added cross-plugin integration filter in `get_where()` method:

```php
// 3. Apply cross-plugin integration filters (e.g., wp-customer filtering by accessible agencies)
$where = apply_filters(
    'wpapp_datatable_app_agency_employees_where',
    $where,
    $_POST,
    $this
);
```

#### 2. Created EmployeeAccessFilter in wp-customer

**File**: `wp-customer/src/Integrations/EmployeeAccessFilter.php` (v1.0.0)

Follows same pattern as AgencyAccessFilter:

```php
public function filter_employees_by_customer($where, $request, $model) {
    // Get accessible agency IDs via branches
    $accessible_agencies = $wpdb->get_col($wpdb->prepare(
        "SELECT DISTINCT b.agency_id
         FROM {$wpdb->prefix}app_customer_branches b
         INNER JOIN {$wpdb->prefix}app_customer_employees ce ON b.id = ce.branch_id
         WHERE ce.user_id = %d
         AND b.agency_id IS NOT NULL",
        $user_id
    ));

    // Filter to accessible agencies only
    $where[] = "e.agency_id IN ({$ids})";
}
```

#### 3. Registered Filter in wp-customer

**File**: `wp-customer/wp-customer.php`

```php
// TODO-2183 Follow-up: Agency employee access filter integration
$employee_access_filter = new \WPCustomer\Integrations\EmployeeAccessFilter();
```

### Critical Fix: Wrong Hook Name (2025-11-01)

**Problem**: After implementation, user andi_budi still saw **50 employees** instead of 3.

**Root Cause**: Wrong hook name!
- Used: `wpapp_datatable_app_agency_employees_where`
- Correct: `wpapp_datatable_agency_employees_where`
- **Reason**: wp-app-core's `get_filter_hook()` removes `app_` prefix from table names

**Fix Applied**:
1. Changed hook name in EmployeeDataTableModel constructor (line 85)
2. Changed hook name in EmployeeAccessFilter constructor (line 53)
3. Updated apply_filters() call in get_where() method (line 209)

**Result**: Filter now works! User sees **3 employees** instead of 50.

### Testing Results

**Test 1: Authorized Access** ✅
- User: andi_budi (ID: 2, accessible agency: 26)
- Request: agency_id = 26
- Result: **3 employees shown** (Joko Lina, Kartika Mira, Kurnia Lukman)
- WHERE: `e.agency_id = 26 AND e.status = 'active' AND e.agency_id IN (26)`
- Records Total: 3, Records Filtered: 3

**Test 2: Blocked Access** ✅
- User: andi_budi (ID: 2, accessible agency: 26)
- Request: agency_id = 21 (unauthorized)
- Result: **0 employees shown** (access blocked)
- WHERE: `e.agency_id = 21 AND e.status = 'active' AND e.agency_id IN (26)`
- Note: Contradictory conditions prevent unauthorized access

### Files Created/Modified

**wp-agency**:
1. `src/Models/Employee/EmployeeDataTableModel.php` (v1.2.1) - Added filter hook

**wp-customer**:
1. `src/Integrations/EmployeeAccessFilter.php` (v1.0.0) - New file
2. `wp-customer.php` - Registered EmployeeAccessFilter
3. `TEST/test-employee-filter.php` - Authorized access test
4. `TEST/test-employee-filter-blocked.php` - Blocked access test

### Integration Pattern

```
Customer Employee (user_id)
    → Branch (branch_id)
        → Agency (agency_id)
            → Agency Employees (filtered)
```

**Access Control Flow**:
1. User views agency page with agency_id in request
2. EmployeeDataTableModel::get_where() builds WHERE conditions
3. Filter `wpapp_datatable_app_agency_employees_where` is applied
4. EmployeeAccessFilter checks user's accessible agencies
5. Adds `e.agency_id IN (accessible_agency_ids)` to WHERE
6. DataTable returns only authorized employees

### Benefits

1. **Consistent Security**: Both agencies AND their employees are filtered by same access rules
2. **No Code Duplication**: Reuses same agency access query from AgencyAccessFilter
3. **Follows Same Pattern**: EmployeeAccessFilter mirrors AgencyAccessFilter architecture
4. **Cross-Plugin Integration**: wp-customer filters wp-agency data without tight coupling

## Follow-up 2: Branch Access Filter - New Companies Tab (2025-11-01)

### Problem
Tab "Perusahaan Baru" (New Companies) in agency dashboard shows **ALL branches** from all customers without inspector, not filtered by user's customer_id.

**Example**:
- User: andi_budi (ID: 2, customer_admin, customer_id: 1)
- Total branches without inspector: 40 (all customers)
- User's branches without inspector: 5 (customer_id = 1)
- **Problem**: User could see all 40 branches instead of only 5

### Root Cause
NewCompanyDataTableModel filters by `agency_id` and `inspector_id IS NULL`, but **NOT by customer_id**.

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Created BranchAccessFilter in wp-customer

**File**: `wp-customer/src/Integrations/BranchAccessFilter.php` (v1.0.0)

Filters customer branches by user's customer_id:

```php
public function filter_branches_by_customer($where, $request, $model) {
    // Get user's customer_id from employee record
    $employee = $wpdb->get_row($wpdb->prepare(
        "SELECT * FROM {$wpdb->prefix}app_customer_employees WHERE user_id = %d",
        $user_id
    ));

    // Filter to customer's branches only
    $where[] = $wpdb->prepare('b.customer_id = %d', $employee->customer_id);
}
```

#### 2. Registered Filter in wp-customer

**File**: `wp-customer/wp-customer.php`

```php
// TODO-2183 Follow-up: Branch access filter integration (new companies tab)
$branch_access_filter = new \WPCustomer\Integrations\BranchAccessFilter();
```

### Testing Results

**Test: Branch Filtering** ✅
- User: andi_budi (ID: 2, customer_id: 1, accessible agency: 26)
- Total branches (all customers): 40
- Customer's branches (customer_id = 1): 5
  - ID 12: agency_id = 26 ✓
  - ID 13: agency_id = 25
  - ID 14: agency_id = 29
  - ID 55: agency_id = 26 ✓
  - ID 56: agency_id = 21
- **Result**: User sees **2 branches** (ID 12, 55)
- **Filtering**: customer_id = 1 AND agency_id = 26 AND inspector_id IS NULL
- **Verification**: ✅ CORRECT! User only sees branches from their customer that are assigned to their accessible agency

### Files Created/Modified

**wp-customer**:
1. `src/Integrations/BranchAccessFilter.php` (v1.0.0) - New file
2. `wp-customer.php` - Registered BranchAccessFilter
3. `TEST/test-branch-filter.php` - Test script

### Integration Pattern

```
Customer Employee (user_id)
    → Customer (customer_id)
        → Branches (filtered by customer_id AND agency_id)
```

**Access Control Flow**:
1. User opens agency dashboard → New Companies tab
2. NewCompanyDataTableModel builds WHERE conditions
3. Filter `wpapp_datatable_customer_branches_where` is applied
4. BranchAccessFilter adds `b.customer_id = {user's customer_id}`
5. Combined with agency filter: customer_id AND agency_id AND inspector_id IS NULL
6. DataTable returns only authorized branches

### Benefits

1. **Complete Security Layer**: Agencies → Employees → Branches all filtered
2. **Consistent Pattern**: All three filters follow same architecture
3. **Multiple Filter Combination**: customer_id + agency_id + inspector_id work together
4. **No Data Leakage**: Users cannot see branches from other customers

## Follow-up 3: CRITICAL FIX - Agency List Not Filtered (2025-11-01)

### Problem
User agus_dedi (customer_branch_admin, user_id: 1948) could see **4 agencies** instead of only **1 agency** from their division.

**Root Cause #1**: Wrong hook name (same issue as EmployeeAccessFilter)
- Used: `wpapp_datatable_app_agencies_where`
- Correct: `wpapp_datatable_agencies_where`
- Reason: wp-app-core's `get_filter_hook()` removes `app_` prefix from table names

**Root Cause #2**: Wrong table alias
- AgencyAccessFilter was using `p.id` (province table alias!)
- Should use: `a.id` (agencies table alias)
- The alias detection logic failed because incoming WHERE array was empty

**Root Cause #3**: No division filtering
- AgencyAccessFilter only filtered by accessible agencies (for customer_admin)
- Branch admin needs stricter filtering: single agency from their branch

### Solution Implemented

Updated AgencyAccessFilter (v1.0.1 → v1.1.0):

1. **Fixed Hook Name** (line 54)
   ```php
   // OLD: add_filter('wpapp_datatable_app_agencies_where', ...)
   // NEW: add_filter('wpapp_datatable_agencies_where', ...)
   ```

2. **Fixed Table Alias** (lines 126, 154)
   ```php
   // OLD: Auto-detect alias or default to 'p'
   // NEW: Always use 'a' (AgencyDataTableModel always uses this alias)
   $where[] = $wpdb->prepare('a.id = %d', $employee->user_agency_id);
   ```

3. **Added Division Filtering** (lines 110-137)
   ```php
   // Check if user is branch admin
   $is_branch_admin = !empty($employee->branch_id) && !empty($employee->division_id);

   if ($is_branch_admin) {
       // Filter by single agency from branch (strictest)
       $where[] = $wpdb->prepare('a.id = %d', $employee->user_agency_id);
   } else {
       // Customer admin: filter by all accessible agencies
       $where[] = "a.id IN ({$accessible_agency_ids})";
   }
   ```

### Testing Results

**Complete Division Filter Test** (all 3 tabs):

**TEST 1: Agency List** ✅
- User: agus_dedi (division_id = 61, agency_id = 26)
- Before: 4 agencies (26, 25, 27, 24)
- After: **1 agency** (26)
- Agency: Disnaker Provinsi Jawa Tengah

**TEST 2: Agency Employees** ✅
- Before: 50 employees (all)
- After: **1 employee** (division_id = 61)
- Employee: Joko Lina

**TEST 3: Branches** ✅
- Before: 40 branches (all customers)
- After: **1 branch** (division_id = 61)
- Branch: 0293SV05-06 - PT Karya Digital

**Result**: ✅ ALL TESTS PASSED (3/3)

### Files Modified

**wp-customer**:
1. `src/Integrations/AgencyAccessFilter.php` (v1.0.1 → v1.1.0)
   - Fixed hook name from `wpapp_datatable_app_agencies_where` to `wpapp_datatable_agencies_where`
   - Fixed table alias from `p.id` to `a.id`
   - Added division-based filtering for branch admin
2. `TEST/test-complete-division-filter.php` - Comprehensive test for all 3 tabs

### Architecture Summary

**Three-Layer Filtering System** (all working correctly):

```
1. AgencyAccessFilter (Disnaker List)
   - Branch admin: a.id = {user's branch agency_id}
   - Customer admin: a.id IN ({accessible agency_ids})

2. EmployeeAccessFilter (Staff Tab)
   - Branch admin: e.division_id = X AND e.agency_id = Y
   - Customer admin: e.agency_id IN ({accessible agency_ids})

3. BranchAccessFilter (Perusahaan Baru Tab)
   - Branch admin: b.customer_id = X AND b.division_id = Y
   - Customer admin: b.customer_id = X
```

**Critical Lessons Learned**:
1. Always use correct hook names (check wp-app-core's `get_filter_hook()` logic)
2. Always use correct table aliases (check DataTableModel's FROM clause)
3. Alias detection logic fails if incoming WHERE array is empty
4. Test ALL related DataTables when implementing cross-cutting filters

- **TODO-2071**: Initial cross-plugin integration implementation

## Notes

- AgencyModel::getDataTableData() marked as @deprecated
- Will be removed in future version after transition period
- All new code should use AgencyDataTableModel
- **All three access filters** now support division-based filtering for branch admin role
- **Hook name pattern**: `wpapp_datatable_{table_without_app_prefix}_where`
- **Table alias for agencies**: Always `a` (not `p`)
