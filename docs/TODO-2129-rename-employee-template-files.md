# TODO-2129: Rename Employee Template Files

## Overview
Renamed employee template directory and files to include "customer-" prefix for better specificity and avoid potential conflicts with other plugins.

## Problem
- Employee template directory name was too generic (`employee/`)
- Template filenames were not plugin-specific
- Could potentially conflict with other plugins using similar naming
- Not immediately clear which plugin the templates belong to
- Inconsistent with plugin naming convention

## Solution
Rename template directory from `employee/` to `customer-employee/` and add "customer-" prefix to all template filenames.

## Directory Structure Change

### Before:
```
src/Views/templates/
├── employee/
│   ├── forms/
│   │   ├── create-employee-form.php
│   │   └── edit-employee-form.php
│   └── partials/
│       └── _employee_list.php
```

### After:
```
src/Views/templates/
├── customer-employee/
│   ├── forms/
│   │   ├── create-customer-employee-form.php
│   │   └── edit-customer-employee-form.php
│   └── partials/
│       └── _customer_employee_list.php
```

## Files Renamed

### Directory
```
OLD: src/Views/templates/employee/
NEW: src/Views/templates/customer-employee/
```

### Template Files
```
OLD: src/Views/templates/employee/forms/create-employee-form.php
NEW: src/Views/templates/customer-employee/forms/create-customer-employee-form.php

OLD: src/Views/templates/employee/forms/edit-employee-form.php
NEW: src/Views/templates/customer-employee/forms/edit-customer-employee-form.php

OLD: src/Views/templates/employee/partials/_employee_list.php
NEW: src/Views/templates/customer-employee/partials/_customer_employee_list.php
```

## Files Modified

### 1. src/Views/templates/customer-right-panel.php (line 45)

**Template Include Path Updated**:
```php
// BEFORE:
foreach ([
    'customer/partials/_customer_details.php',
    'branch/partials/_customer_branch_list.php',
    'employee/partials/_employee_list.php'
] as $template) {
    include_once WP_CUSTOMER_PATH . 'src/Views/templates/' . $template;
}

// AFTER:
foreach ([
    'customer/partials/_customer_details.php',
    'branch/partials/_customer_branch_list.php',
    'customer-employee/partials/_customer_employee_list.php'
] as $template) {
    include_once WP_CUSTOMER_PATH . 'src/Views/templates/' . $template;
}
```

### 2. src/Views/templates/customer-employee/partials/_customer_employee_list.php (lines 129-130)

**Form Include Paths Updated**:
```php
// BEFORE:
require_once WP_CUSTOMER_PATH . 'src/Views/templates/employee/forms/create-employee-form.php';
require_once WP_CUSTOMER_PATH . 'src/Views/templates/employee/forms/edit-employee-form.php';

// AFTER:
require_once WP_CUSTOMER_PATH . 'src/Views/templates/customer-employee/forms/create-customer-employee-form.php';
require_once WP_CUSTOMER_PATH . 'src/Views/templates/customer-employee/forms/edit-customer-employee-form.php';
```

### 3. All Template File Headers Updated

**create-customer-employee-form.php** (lines 2-23):
```php
// BEFORE:
/**
 * Create Employee Form Template
 * @subpackage  Views/Templates/Employee/Forms
 * Path: /wp-customer/src/Views/templates/employee/forms/create-employee-form.php
 */

// AFTER:
/**
 * Create Customer Employee Form Template
 * @subpackage  Views/Templates/CustomerEmployee/Forms
 * Path: /wp-customer/src/Views/templates/customer-employee/forms/create-customer-employee-form.php
 */
```

**edit-customer-employee-form.php** (lines 2-23):
```php
// BEFORE:
/**
 * Edit Employee Form Template
 * @subpackage  Views/Templates/Employee/Forms
 * Path: /wp-customer/src/Views/templates/employee/forms/edit-employee-form.php
 */

// AFTER:
/**
 * Edit Customer Employee Form Template
 * @subpackage  Views/Templates/CustomerEmployee/Forms
 * Path: /wp-customer/src/Views/templates/customer-employee/forms/edit-customer-employee-form.php
 */
```

**_customer_employee_list.php** (lines 2-22):
```php
// BEFORE:
/**
 * Employee List Template
 * @subpackage  Views/Templates/Employee/Partials
 * Path: /wp-customer/src/Views/templates/employee/partials/_employee_list.php
 */

// AFTER:
/**
 * Customer Employee List Template
 * @subpackage  Views/Templates/CustomerEmployee/Partials
 * Path: /wp-customer/src/Views/templates/customer-employee/partials/_customer_employee_list.php
 */
```

## What Was NOT Changed

### HTML IDs and Classes
Element IDs and CSS classes within templates remain unchanged:
- `#create-employee-form` - Form ID
- `#edit-employee-form` - Form ID
- `#employee-list` - Tab content ID
- `.wp-customer-employee-header` - CSS class
- `.employee-loading-state` - CSS class
- `#employee-table` - DataTable ID

**Reason**: These are internal identifiers scoped to specific pages and referenced by JavaScript/CSS. Changing them would require updates across multiple JS and CSS files with no real benefit.

### Controller Methods
No controller methods were modified as they don't reference template paths directly.

## Testing Checklist

After implementing these changes, verify:

1. **Template Loading**:
   - ✅ Customer right panel loads correctly
   - ✅ Staff tab displays employee list
   - ✅ No 404 errors for missing templates
   - ✅ No PHP warnings about missing files

2. **Form Modals**:
   - ✅ Create employee modal opens
   - ✅ Edit employee modal opens
   - ✅ Form submissions work
   - ✅ Validation works

3. **DataTable**:
   - ✅ Employee table initializes
   - ✅ Data loads correctly
   - ✅ Pagination works
   - ✅ Search works

4. **Functionality**:
   - ✅ Create employee works
   - ✅ Edit employee works
   - ✅ Delete employee works
   - ✅ Change status works
   - ✅ Toast notifications appear

## Benefits

1. **Better Namespacing**: Templates now clearly belong to wp-customer plugin
2. **Conflict Prevention**: Reduced risk of template name conflicts with other plugins
3. **Consistency**: Aligns with plugin naming convention (customer-* prefix)
4. **Maintainability**: Easier to identify plugin templates in file listings
5. **Professional**: Shows attention to detail and proper WordPress development practices
6. **Clarity**: Immediately clear that these are customer employee templates, not agency employee templates

## Technical Notes

- All changes are backward compatible within the plugin scope
- No database changes required
- No cache clearing needed
- Template content remains unchanged - only paths and filenames updated
- Git history preserved through file moves
- Old `employee/` directory removed after successful move

## Related Files

This change affects the following file types:
- **Templates**: 3 files renamed and relocated
- **PHP Include/Require**: 2 files modified (customer-right-panel.php, _customer_employee_list.php)
- **File Headers**: 3 files updated with new paths

## Notes

This task complements TODO-2128 (Rename Employee Assets Files). Together, they ensure all employee-related files have consistent, plugin-specific naming:
- Assets (CSS/JS): `customer-employee-*`
- Templates: `customer-employee/*` directory with `customer-employee-*` filenames
