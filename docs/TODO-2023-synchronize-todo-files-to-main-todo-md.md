# TODO-2023: Synchronize TODO-XXXX Files to Main TODO.md

## Issue Description
Several TODO-XXXX files in the docs folder were not synchronized with the main TODO.md file, causing documentation inconsistency and making it difficult to track all tasks from a single source of truth.

## Problem Details
The following TODO files existed in the docs folder but were missing or incomplete in TODO.md:
- docs/TODO-2111-investigate-cache-key-in-company-dataTable.md was completely missing from TODO.md
- All other TODO-20XX and TODO-21XX files were already present in TODO.md

## Investigation Findings

### TODO Files Found in docs/ folder (14 files):
1. TODO-2020-fix-branch-form-console-log-on-customer-view.md ✅ Present in TODO.md
2. TODO-2021-create-company-invoice-page.md ✅ Present in TODO.md
3. TODO-2022-enhances-company-invoice.md ✅ Present in TODO.md
4. TODO-2110-membuat-tombol-reload-pada-datatable-company.md ✅ Present in TODO.md
5. TODO-2111-investigate-cache-key-in-company-dataTable.md ❌ **Missing from TODO.md**
6. TODO-2112-remove-customer-level-membership-tab-and-unused-files.md ✅ Present in TODO.md
7. TODO-2113-remove-test-text-from-branch-demo-data.md ✅ Present in TODO.md
8. TODO-2114-fix-undefined-methods-in-CompanyMembershipModel.md ✅ Present in TODO.md
9. TODO-2115-implement-customer-invoices-table.md ✅ Present in TODO.md
10. TODO-2116-fix-table-name-mismatch-branches.md ✅ Present in TODO.md
11. TODO-2117-implement-customer-invoices-components.md ✅ Present in TODO.md
12. TODO-2118-implement-customer-payments-components.md ✅ Present in TODO.md
13. TODO-2119-tambah-filter-aktif-tidak-aktif-datatable-company.md ✅ Present in TODO.md
14. TODO-2122-create-company-invoice-demo-data.md ✅ Present in TODO.md

### Root Cause
TODO-2111 was created as a documentation file but was never added to the main TODO.md tracking file. This likely happened during the investigation phase where the focus was on documenting findings rather than updating the central TODO list.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added TODO-2111 to TODO.md
Inserted TODO-2111 entry in chronological order between TODO-2110 and TODO-2112 with the following information:
- Issue description: DataTable cache not clearing after inspector assignment
- Root cause: Cached response persists for 2 minutes (120 seconds)
- Investigation findings: Cache details documented
- Affected files: DataTable JS, Controller, Model, Cache Manager
- Proposed solution: Cross-plugin cache invalidation
- Status: Investigation completed, solution proposed
- Reference: docs/TODO-2111-investigate-cache-key-in-company-dataTable.md

### 2. Created TODO-2023 Documentation File
Created this file to document the synchronization task itself, following the established pattern of creating detailed TODO documentation in the docs folder.

### 3. Verification
Confirmed that all other TODO-XXXX files from the docs folder are already present in TODO.md with proper formatting and status tracking.

## Files Modified
- `/TODO.md` - Added TODO-2111 entry (lines 105-111)
- `/docs/TODO-2023-synchronize-todo-files-to-main-todo-md.md` - Created this documentation file

## Status
✅ Completed

## Notes
- The original task description mentioned TODO-2021 and TODO-2122 as missing, but verification showed they were already present in TODO.md (lines 58 and 31 respectively)
- Only TODO-2111 was actually missing from TODO.md
- All 14 TODO-XXXX files in the docs folder are now synchronized with TODO.md
- This task ensures consistency between detailed documentation in docs/ and the master tracking file TODO.md

## Lessons Learned
1. Always update TODO.md when creating new TODO-XXXX documentation files in the docs folder
2. Periodically audit docs/ folder against TODO.md to catch synchronization gaps
3. Investigation tasks should also be tracked in TODO.md even if they don't involve code changes
4. Reference links to docs/TODO-XXXX.md files help maintain traceability

- All TODO-20XX and TODO-21XX entries: Now verified as synchronized
