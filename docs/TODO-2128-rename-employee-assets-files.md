# TODO-2128: Rename Employee Assets Files

## Overview
Renamed all employee asset files (CSS and JS) to include "customer-" prefix for better specificity and avoid potential conflicts with other plugins.

## Problem
- Employee asset filenames were too generic (employee-style.css, employee-toast.js, etc.)
- Could potentially conflict with other plugins using similar naming
- Not immediately clear which plugin the files belong to
- Inconsistent with plugin naming convention

## Solution
Add "customer-" prefix to all employee asset files to make them plugin-specific.

## Files Renamed

### CSS Files
```
OLD: assets/css/employee/employee-style.css
NEW: assets/css/employee/customer-employee-style.css

OLD: assets/css/employee/employee-toast.css
NEW: assets/css/employee/customer-employee-toast.css
```

### JavaScript Files
```
OLD: assets/js/employee/create-employee-form.js
NEW: assets/js/employee/create-customer-employee-form.js

OLD: assets/js/employee/edit-employee-form.js
NEW: assets/js/employee/edit-customer-employee-form.js

OLD: assets/js/employee/employee-datatable.js
NEW: assets/js/employee/customer-employee-datatable.js

OLD: assets/js/employee/employee-toast.js
NEW: assets/js/employee/customer-employee-toast.js
```

## What Was NOT Changed

### Window Object Names
Window object names were kept as-is because they are already appropriately named:
- `EmployeeToast` - Clearly indicates employee toast functionality
- `EmployeeDataTable` - Clearly indicates employee datatable
- `CreateEmployeeForm` - Clearly indicates create employee form
- `EditEmployeeForm` - Clearly indicates edit employee form

These names are:
- ✅ Specific to their purpose
- ✅ Not generic enough to cause conflicts
- ✅ Follow JavaScript naming conventions (PascalCase for objects)
- ✅ Scoped to window object (explicit namespace)

### WordPress Handle Names
WordPress enqueue handles were kept as-is:
- `wp-customer-employee` (CSS)
- `employee-toast` (CSS & JS)
- `employee-datatable` (JS)
- `create-employee-form` (JS)
- `edit-employee-form` (JS)

These are:
- ✅ Internal WordPress identifiers only
- ✅ Not exposed to global scope
- ✅ Consistent with other parts of the codebase

### HTML Form IDs
Form IDs in templates remain unchanged:
- `#create-employee-form`
- `#edit-employee-form`

These are:
- ✅ Scoped to specific pages
- ✅ Not likely to conflict
- ✅ Referenced in JavaScript files

## Testing Checklist

After implementing these changes, verify:

1. **CSS Loading**:
   - ✅ Employee styles load correctly on customer detail page
   - ✅ Toast styles apply correctly
   - ✅ No 404 errors in browser console

2. **JavaScript Loading**:
   - ✅ All employee JS files load without errors
   - ✅ DataTable initializes correctly
   - ✅ Create form works
   - ✅ Edit form works
   - ✅ Toast notifications appear

3. **Functionality**:
   - ✅ Create employee works
   - ✅ Edit employee works
   - ✅ Delete employee works
   - ✅ Change status works
   - ✅ DataTable refreshes properly

4. **No Breaking Changes**:
   - ✅ Window objects accessible (EmployeeToast, EmployeeDataTable, etc.)
   - ✅ Form submissions work
   - ✅ AJAX requests succeed

## Benefits

1. **Better Namespacing**: Files now clearly belong to wp-customer plugin
2. **Conflict Prevention**: Reduced risk of filename conflicts with other plugins
3. **Consistency**: Aligns with plugin naming convention (customer-* prefix)
4. **Maintainability**: Easier to identify plugin assets in file listings
5. **Professional**: Shows attention to detail and proper plugin development practices

## Technical Notes

- All changes are backward compatible within the plugin scope
- No database changes required
- No cache clearing needed (WordPress handles cache-busting via version parameter)
- File content remains unchanged - only filenames and references updated
- Git history preserved through file moves
