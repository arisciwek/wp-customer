# TODO-2023: Fix Spinning Icon on Membership Tab

/wp-customer/docs/TODO-2023-icon-berputar-pada-tab-membership.md

## Issue
- Spinning icon appears on membership tab
- Data is not displaying
- Location: /wp-customer/src/Views/templates/company/partials/_company_membership.php

## Root Cause Analysis
After reviewing the code:
1. The JavaScript file `company-membership.js` is trying to load membership data
2. The AJAX endpoint `get_company_membership_status` is registered in CompanyController
3. The CompanyMembershipController has a method `userCanAccessCompany` that doesn't exist (should be `userCanAccessCustomer`)
4. The JavaScript is not properly handling the loading state after errors

## Solution Plan
1. Fix the method name issue in CompanyMembershipController
2. Ensure proper error handling in JavaScript
3. Fix the loading spinner removal on error
4. Verify AJAX endpoints are properly registered

## Tasks
- [x] Fix method name `userCanAccessCompany` to `userCanAccessCustomer` in CompanyMembershipController
- [x] Update JavaScript to properly handle loading states
- [x] Add better error logging for debugging
- [x] Fix loading state management between loadAllMembershipLevels and loadMembershipStatus
- [x] Fix all findByCustomer method calls to use findByCompany
- [x] Test the membership tab functionality
