# WP Customer Release Notes - Version 1.0.8

## Overview
This release focuses on implementing Model-level cache management following WP Agency patterns, fixing DataTable refresh issues, and improving overall performance and architecture consistency.

## 🚀 New Features & Enhancements

### TODO-2127: Implement Model-Level Cache Management for Customer Employee
- **Issue**: Edit employee succeeded in database but DataTable didn't refresh - had to click other menu first then return to Staff tab to see changes. Model had no cache in find() method - always hit database, cache invalidation only in Controller layer (incomplete), related caches (counts, lists, datatables) not cleared on update/delete.

- **Root Cause**:
  - WP Customer used setTimeout(500) for delayed DataTable refresh (different from WP Agency's direct refresh)
  - No cache management implementation in Model layer like WP Agency
  - Cache invalidation scattered in Controller and not comprehensive

- **Solution Implemented**:
  1. **Removed setTimeout() Delay Pattern**
     - Changed from setTimeout(500) to direct DataTable refresh
     - Follows proven WP Agency pattern
     - Eliminates race conditions with modal close animation

  2. **Model-Level Cache Management**
     - Added cache read in `find()` method
     - Comprehensive cache invalidation in `update()`, `delete()`, `changeStatus()`
     - Parameterized cache keys using CustomerCacheManager pattern

  3. **Controller Cleanup**
     - Removed duplicate cache operations from Controller
     - Controller stays thin (validation + coordination only)
     - Single Responsibility Principle maintained

- **Files Modified**:
  - `assets/js/employee/edit-employee-form.js` - Direct refresh without setTimeout
  - `src/Models/Employee/CustomerEmployeeModel.php` - Cache support in find, comprehensive invalidation
  - `src/Controllers/Employee/CustomerEmployeeController.php` - Removed duplicate cache operations

- **Benefits**:
  - ✅ DataTable updates immediately after create/edit/delete/status change
  - ✅ Cache reads in find() reduce database load
  - ✅ Comprehensive cache invalidation prevents stale data
  - ✅ Controller stays thin (validation + coordination only)
  - ✅ Performance improvement from cache reads
  - ✅ Architecture matches proven WP Agency pattern

### TODO-2126: Fix 403 Forbidden Error on Staff Tab
- **Issue**: Error 403 Forbidden when clicking Staff tab on customer detail page, causing all employee buttons to fail (add, edit, delete, approve, deactivate).

- **Root Cause**: `check_ajax_referer()` without third parameter causes WordPress to die with 403 when nonce validation fails, preventing proper error messages.

- **Solution**: Changed all nonce checks to non-fatal version with proper error handling, allowing JSON error responses instead of 403 die.

- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/Controllers/Employee/CustomerEmployeeController.php` (7 methods: handleDataTableRequest, createEmployeeButton, show, store, update, delete, changeStatus)

- **Benefits**:
  - ✅ All employee CRUD operations now work correctly
  - ✅ Proper JSON error responses instead of 403 die
  - ✅ Security validation remains intact with improved error handling

### TODO-2125: Fix Duplicate Customer Data Loading on View Click
- **Issue**: Cache debug logs showed customer data loaded twice when clicking View button on customer DataTable, triggering duplicate cache access for the same customer.

- **Root Cause**: Controller call flow - show() called validateAccess() first which triggered find(), then show() called find() again.

- **Solution**: Reordered operations in show() method - call find() first to set cache, then validateAccess() uses that cached data.

- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/Controllers/CustomerController.php` (show method)

- **Benefits**:
  - ✅ Optimized cache usage - first find() sets cache, second find() uses cache
  - ✅ No duplicate database queries
  - ✅ Cache works as designed

### TODO-2124: Fix Duplicate Invoice Data Loading on View Click
- **Issue**: Cache debug logs showed invoice data loaded twice when clicking View button on company invoice DataTable, triggering duplicate AJAX requests and cache operations.

- **Root Cause**: JavaScript call flow - viewInvoiceDetails() loaded data, then renderInvoiceDetails() called switchTab() which loaded data AGAIN because switchTab() always re-loaded data on tab change.

- **Solution**: Added shouldLoadData parameter to switchTab() to prevent unnecessary re-loading when data is already rendered.

- **Files Modified**:
  - `assets/js/company/company-invoice-script.js` (update switchTab method, pass false from renderInvoiceDetails)

- **Benefits**:
  - ✅ Reduced AJAX requests by 50%
  - ✅ Invoice data now loaded once per View click instead of twice

### TODO-2123: Fix Total Pembayaran Not Matching Paid Invoices
- **Issue**: Total Pembayaran on Company Invoice dashboard always showed 0, even though there were paid invoices.

- **Root Cause**:
  - ID mismatch between template (#total-payments) and JavaScript (#total-paid-amount)
  - Model counted payment records instead of summing paid invoice amounts

- **Solution**:
  - Fixed ID mismatch in dashboard template
  - Updated getStatistics() to calculate SUM(amount) from invoices with status='paid'
  - Added paid_invoices count and total_paid_amount fields

- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/Views/templates/company-invoice/company-invoice-dashboard.php` (fix ID to total-paid-amount)
  - `src/Models/Company/CompanyInvoiceModel.php` (getStatistics calculation logic)

- **Benefits**:
  - ✅ Total Pembayaran now accurately reflects paid invoice amounts
  - ✅ Changed from COUNT(payments) to SUM(invoice.amount WHERE status='paid')
  - ✅ Added null coalescing for empty results

## 🏗️ Architecture Improvements

### Before (Controller-Level Cache):
```
Controller                          Model
-----------                         -----
validate() ──┐
             ├──> model.update()
             │
invalidate_cache() ✗ (incomplete)
```

**Problems**:
- ❌ Cache invalidation incomplete (only DataTable, missing counts)
- ❌ Controller mixed responsibility (business logic + cache)
- ❌ No cache on read operations (find always hits DB)

### After (Model-Level Cache) - WP Agency Pattern:
```
Controller              Model
-----------            -----
validate() ──┐         find() ──> check_cache() ──> db_query() ──> cache_result()
             │                          ↓
             ├──────> update()         comprehensive_invalidation()
                                       ├─> delete('customer_employee', id)
                                       ├─> delete('customer_employee_count', customer_id)
                                       ├─> delete('customer_active_employee_count', customer_id)
                                       └─> invalidateDataTableCache(...)
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Cache reads in find() reduce DB load
- ✅ Comprehensive cache invalidation in Model
- ✅ Controller stays thin (validation + coordination only)
- ✅ Single Responsibility Principle maintained
- ✅ Matches proven WP Agency architecture

## 🧪 Testing

All fixes have been tested to ensure:
1. **Create Employee**: DataTable immediately shows new employee
2. **Update Employee**: Changes display immediately without clicking other menu
3. **Delete Employee**: Row removed from DataTable immediately
4. **Change Status**: Status badge updates immediately
5. **Cache Performance**: First read hits DB, second read uses cache, after update cache cleared
6. **No 403 Errors**: All employee operations work correctly
7. **No Duplicate Loads**: View operations load data once, not twice
8. **Accurate Statistics**: Payment totals match actual paid invoices

## 📝 Technical Details

- All fixes maintain backward compatibility
- No new dependencies added
- Improved error logging for better debugging
- Architecture follows WP Agency proven patterns
- Cache management now centralized in Model layer
